# Wine Quality Prediction -

The primary extend is to find out the quality of Wine based on the components given within the dataset. here we have 11 independent variables and 1 dependant/Target variable that's quality.

1. Volatile acidity is the gaseous acid present in wine.

2. fixed acidity: Primarily fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic.

3. residual sugar is the amount of sugar left after fermentation.

4. acid is a weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.

5. chlorides are the Amount of salt present in wine.

6. free sulfur dioxide i.e. So2 is used for the prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.

7. total sulfur dioxide

8. alcohol is the Percent of alcohol present in wine.

9. sulphates are Added sulfites that preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.

10. pH is used for checking acidity.

11. density.

By using Exploratory Data Analysis, the relationship between the quality of wine with its chemical compositions can be found out. After that, we partition the wine into two categories, i.e., Good and Bad. after applying different machine learning algorithms we get different model accuracies such as, Logistic regression with 87.30%, Decision Tree Classifier with 88.25%, Support Vector Machine with 89.20%, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with 89.52% accuracy.
